In the year 1842, a most generous offer made to me by the present Duke of Northumberland (then Lord Prdhoe) enabled me to undertake the composition of this work; and to His Grace's princely aid I have ever since been mainly indebted for the means of accomplishing the project thus originated.

   The object proposed was not to do in English little more than what Golius and others had alread done in Lain, by translating and composing from a few Arabic lexicons of the class of eiptomes or abstracts or manuals; but to draw chiefly from the most copious Easter sources; one of which, comprising in about one seventh part of its contents the whole of the celebrated Ḳámoos, I knew to exist in Cario, There, also, I had reason to believe that I might find other sources unknown in  Europe, and obtain more aid in the prosecution of my design than I could elsewhere; and thither, therefore, I betook myselft for this purpose.

   On my arrival at Cario, I first had recourse, for help in making my preparations, to an accomplished Arabic Scholor, the late M. Fulgenee Fresnel, with whom, during a former residence in Egypt, I had contracted an initimate friendship. Previously informed by me of my project, he had tested the qualifications of serveral learned natives for the task of assisting me in collecting, transcribing, and collating, the materials from which my lexicon was to be composed; and he recommended to me, as the person whome he esteemed the most fit, the sheykh Ibráheem (surnamed 'Abd-el-Ghaffár) Ed-Dasooḳee. To have engaged as my coadjutor a shekykh respected for this character and learning, and to have benn disappointed in him, and obliged to dismiss hi, might have made him my enemy, and enabled and induced him to baffle my scheme; but my experience led me to believe that a person better qualified for the services that I required of him than the sheykh Ibráheem Ed-Dasooḳee, could not have been found by me in Cairo; and I had no occation ot employ any other assistant, except, occasionally, transcribers, under his supervision.

   The assistance that I received from my friend M. Fresnel was not limited to the favour mentioned above. With a generosity rarely equalled, he insisted upon transferring to me the most valuable of his Arabic manuscripts, to remain with me during the whole period of the compostion of my lexicon, and in case of this death during that period to become my absolute property. Most deeply do I deplore his not having lived to see how greatly those precious manuscripts have contributed to the accuracy and value of my work, and to have them restored to him. They consist of two copies of the Ṣiḥáḥ and a copy of the Ḳámoos. One of the copies of the former lexicon is a manuscript of extraordinary excellence: it was finished in the year of the Flight 676 (A.D. 1277); and forms a large quarto-volume. The other copy of the same lexcion is in three numerous important extracts, in its margins, form the celebrated Annotations of the Ibn-Barree and El-Busṭee: the first volume is similarly enrished, and little inferior to the second in accuracy: the third is of the ordinary quality. The copy of the Ḳámoos, wichi s written in a very small and copact hand, and fors a single octavo-volume, I believe to be unqiue: it contains, in tis margins, (with other annotations and with various readings,) copius extracts from the great work which is the main source my own lexicon; and its text, of which the transcription was finished in the year of the Flight 1120 (A.D. 1708-0), has been carefully collated. These valuable acquisitions I made almost immediately after my arrival at Cairo.

   It was indispensable, I believe, to the success of my understaking, that I should most carefully avoid whatever might drawn down disrepect from the 'Ulamà of Cairo, or others of the Muslim inhabitants, either upon myself or upon the shekyk
